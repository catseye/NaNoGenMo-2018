# The League of Extraordinarily Dull Gentlemen

### Goals

* **To tell a single story over the course of 50,000 words.**

(There were other goals but this turned out to be the main one.)

### Code

The generator consists of a [world-description in 930 lines of Samovar](Extraordinarily-Dull.samovar)
and a [363-line Python 3 script that renders the generated events into sentences](producer.py).
There is also a GNU Makefile that orchestrates building the thing.

The version of Samovar used was 0.2.  For more information on Samovar, see
[its entry at Cat's Eye Technologies](http://catseye.tc/node/Samovar) or
[its repository on GitHub](https://github.com/catseye/Samovar).
