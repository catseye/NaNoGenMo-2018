# The Defeat at Procyon V

_Being an Episode in the Later Career of Super Admiral Serenity O’James of the Space Fighters_

## Chapter 1

Fleet Commander Dmitry Ng stood at attention before the desk of Super Admiral Serenity O’James
and saluted.

“At ease, Ng,” she mumbled, not looking up from her paperwork.  “What is it?”

“Ma’am, I regret to inform you that the units of 19th Squadron 8th Division have failed
to hold our outpost at Procyon V.  The enemy staged a surprise attack in full force with
a barrage of long range electron torpedos.”

Serenity O’James turned her eyes upward to the Fleet Commander and frowned.

“Long range electron torpedos? Could we not counter those with our positronic muon beams?”

“Absolutely!  However, they counter-attacked with atomic antimatter lasers.”

“What about our guided antimatter bombs?”

“We deployed them immediately!  But to our surprise they were equipped with quantum neutron rays.”

Super Admiral O’James leaned back in her chair.  “Surely our atomic destructo missiles would be able to fend those off.”

“Yes!  But to our surprise they were equipped with supercharged laser missiles.”

“Did we not have guided destructo rockets to counter with?”

“Of course!  But the enemy neutralized them with their subatomic frag torpedos.”

“Were we not equipped with composite wavelet beams?”

“A full complement!  But the enemy neutralized them with their armor-piercing photon cannons.”

“Did we not have quantum laser rockets to counter with?”

“Of course!  But to our surprise they were equipped with heat-seeking graviton beams.”

“So we responded with our stealth photon rockets, I presume?”

“Just as our training dictates!  Alas, these were no match for their supercharged positron bombs.”

“Were we not equipped with quantum plasma disruptors?”

“Absolutely!  But these were not sufficient against their atomic assault bombs.”

“Surely our stealth gluon lasers would be able to fend those off.”

“Absolutely!  But the enemy neutralized them with their heat-seeking muon lasers.”

“Were we not equipped with atomic graviton cannons?”

“A full complement!  However, they counter-attacked with heat-seeking neutron rockets.”

“What about our atomic plasma disruptors?”

“Absolutely we used those!  But the enemy neutralized them with their positronic destructo disruptors.”

“So we responded with our long range disruptor beams, I presume?”

“Absolutely!  But the enemy neutralized them with their atomic frag torpedos.”

“What about our long range neutrino rockets?”

“Absolutely we used those!  But it turned out they also had positronic graviton bombs.”

“So we responded with our subatomic photon cannons, I presume?”

“Yes, just so!  But these were not sufficient against their guided neutrino missiles.”

Super Admiral O’James opened the drawer of her desk.  “What about our atomic graviton rays?”

Fleet Commander Ng made a small refusal gesture in the direction of the biscuits.  “Of course!  Alas, these were no match for their atomic antimatter beams.”

Super Admiral O’James gave the Fleet Commander a tight-lipped smile and made a repeated lifting motion.  “Did we not have quantum warp blasters to counter with?”

Fleet Commander Ng struck a vaguely conciliatory pose and took a biscuit.  “In spades!  But these were not sufficient against their subatomic warp disruptors.”

Serenity O’James was silent for a long moment.  Finally, she let out a low whistle.
“Isomorphic neutron lasers, huh.”

“Yes, ma’am,” responded the Fleet Commander efficiently.

“That’s... unfortunate.”

“Yes, ma’am.”  What else was there to say?

“Well. Well, well, well. Well, I suppose the way is open for them to send their fleet
straight to Tau Ceti, now.  But at least they still have no idea where our key base is hidden.”

“Very true, Super Admiral.  That information is safe and sound in our unbreachable
data network.  They will never locate our key base!”

## Chapter 2

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to these two, a thousand parsecs away, two young Cyber Sappers
were jacked in to the Space Fighters’ main combat mainframe.

“Deploy the modular corruptor exploit!”

“Deployed. Alert! They've responded with a crypto honeypot virus!”

“Ah, but they haven't counted on our modular decompiler zero-day...”
